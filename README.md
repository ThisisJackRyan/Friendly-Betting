# Friendly-Betting
This is a betting web app. However, this is not a sports betting app but rather a way to bet on real life and share with your friends, hence the name Friendly bets. Have you ever had a small bet with friends or family? Like "How many times will Grandpa bring up politics on Thanksgiving" or "Who out of your friend group will be latests to the function". With Friendly Bets you can place a Money line and Over under bets and Scan the QR code to turn everyday moments into thrilling opportunities. So go ahead, create a bet, challenge your friends, and let the games begin!

Go ahead, Create a account and Start betting.
